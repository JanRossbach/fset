# fset

A Clojure library designed to automatically rewrite B machines using lisb.
The rewrite removes enumerated and deferred sets up to a certain size and replaces them with boolean variables.
This is done to increase performance of partial order reduction optimizations in prob.

## Usage

- start a repl with
```
lein repl
```
- Run the core functions in a repl
- Examples can be found in experiment.clj
- Configuration can be done in config.clj
