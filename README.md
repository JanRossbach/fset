# fset

A Clojure library designed to automatically rewrite B machines using lisb.
The rewrite removes enumerated and deferred sets up to a certain size and replaces them with boolean variables.
This is done to increase performance of partial order reduction optimizations in prob.

## Usage

- start a repl with
```
lein repl
```
- In order to translate a B machine, load the machines IR using lisb and run the boolencode function from the core namespace
- Examples can be found in repl.clj and in the core tests
