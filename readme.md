# fset

A Clojure library designed to automatically rewrite B machines using lisb.
The rewrite removes enumerated and deferred sets up to a certain size and replaces them with boolean variables.
This is done to increase performance of partial order reduction optimizations in prob.

## Installation

This tool is still in development. If you want to try it out anyway,
clone this repositoriy and start a repl with the dev alias. You can then run the functions as described below.

## Basic Usage and Configuration

``` clojure
(ns myns.core
  (:require
    [hhu.fset.lib.core :as fset]
    [lisb.translation.util :refer [b->ir ir->b]]))

(def ir (b->ir (slurp "path/to/b/machine"))) ;; Read in the B machine IR from a file

(fset/unroll-ops ir) ;; Just unrolling operations

(fset/boolencode ir) ;; Translation using the default config

(fset/boolencode ir :excluded-vars :all) ; Configuration can be done through kwargs
(fset/boolencode ir :excluded-vars #{:var1 :var2})

(fset/boolencode ir :logging true)

;; Or you can do a complete personal configuration
(def my-config
  {:max-unroll-size 200 ;; Upper bound for variable size
   :deff-set-size 2 ;; How many variables should deferred sets be expanded to?
   :logging true ;; Info level logging including errors and unsupported expressions
   :prob-logging false ;; All logging enabled including prob debugging
   :excluded-vars #{}}) ;; Exclude individual variables from being expanded

(fset/set-config! my-config) ;; You can apply your config as the default for the session

(fset/set-config-var! :logging false) ;; You can also set individual vars like that

(def result-ir (fset/boolencode ir)) ; This uses my-config but with logging set to false

(ir->b result-ir) ;; Translate the results back to B

```
